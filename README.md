# LW_IA42
An IA for Leek Wars

Some coding conventions:
- A tool is both a weapon and a chip.
- An leek is both an ally and an enemy.
- An item is both a leek and a tool.
- Functions should be as generic as possible.
- Functions should be separate and only the main file must call functions from other files.

/!\ Always test before comitting !
